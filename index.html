      <span>About</span>
      <a href="https://nomadcoders.co/">Nomad Coder</a>
      provides programming lecture videos and educational curriculum through its
      website. Most of the lectures consist of "clone coding" that creates the
      same existing websites or apps, and instead of learning the basics step by
      step, programmers are teaching necessary concepts while cloning as if
      learning a new language. Unlike other existing lectures that are not very
      helpful if you focus on grammar and other side-by-side contents, it is
      receiving favorable reviews for being able to focus on learning high-use
      parts through practical development.
